## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guide

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new file in `src/pages/` with your page component
2. Add the route in `src/App.jsx`
3. Add a navigation link in `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`

Example:
```jsx
// src/pages/NewPage.jsx
import React from 'react';

const NewPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>New Page</h1>
      {/* Page content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default NewPage;

// Add to routes in App.jsx
<Route path="/new-page" element={<NewPage />} />

// Add to sidebar in Sidebar.jsx
<SidebarItem icon={<Icon />} href="/new-page" label="New Page" />
```

### Adding New Components

1. Create a component file in the appropriate feature folder
2. Use the component where needed

Example:
```jsx
// src/components/sales/SalesFilter.jsx
import React from 'react';

const SalesFilter = ({ onFilter }) => {
  // Component implementation
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Filter UI */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SalesFilter;
```

### Using the Global Context

The application uses a central AppContext for global state management:

```jsx
import { useAppContext } from '@/context/AppContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { products, customers, currentUser, hasPermission } = useAppContext();
  
  // Check permission before rendering
  if (!hasPermission('canManageProducts')) {
    return <p>Access denied</p>;
  }
  
  return (
    // Component implementation
  );
};
```

### Form Handling

The application uses React Hook Form with Zod validation:

```jsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define schema
const formSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, 'Name is too short'),
  price: z.number().min(0, 'Price cannot be negative'),
});

// Use in component
const MyForm = () => {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      name: '',
      price: 0,
    },
  });
  
  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    // Handle form submission
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Styling Components

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling:

```jsx
// Example of responsive styling
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
    {/* Card content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## üìä Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**:
   - User credentials are validated in the `AppContext`
   - User permissions are determined by their role
   - Protected routes check for authentication

2. **Data Management**:
   - Global state is managed in the `AppContext`
   - Components access data through the `useAppContext` hook
   - Updates are made through context methods

3. **Form Submission**:
   - Forms are validated with Zod schemas
   - Submissions update the global state
   - Success/error messages are shown with toast notifications

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

Key configuration files:

- `vite.config.js`: Vite bundler configuration
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration
- `index.css`: CSS variables for theming

## üß™ Best Practices

1. **Component Design**:
   - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
   - Use composition to build complex UIs from simple components
   - Follow consistent naming conventions

2. **State Management**:
   - Use local state for component-specific data
   - Use context for shared state across components
   - Keep state updates predictable and traceable

3. **Performance**:
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implement proper dependency arrays in hooks
   - Optimize renders with React.memo where appropriate

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast
   - Include appropriate ARIA attributes

5. **Code Organization**:
   - Group related files together
   - Keep file sizes manageable
   - Document complex logic with comments
